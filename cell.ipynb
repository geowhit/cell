    "## Instructions\n",
    "The following sections will introduce you to the concept of Cellular Automota, which are one of many algorithms used to model the microstructure of concrete. We will also give you a walkthrough of basic python syntax and libraries necessary for the exercise. Follow the instructions in each section to build and test, and explore your own cellular automota.\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Cellular automata are discrete dynamical systems evolving on a grid of cells. These cells can be in a finite number of states (for example, on/off). The evolution of a cellular automaton is governed by a set of rules, describing how the state of a cell changes according to the state of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although extremely simple, these models can initiate highly complex and chaotic behaviors. Cellular automata can model real-world phenomena such as car traffic, chemical reactions, propagation of fire in a forest, epidemic propagations, and much more. Cellular automata are also found in nature. For example, the patterns of some seashells are generated by natural cellular automata.\n",

    "<br>As discussed in _H. Jennings, J. Bullard \"From electrons to infrastructure: Engineering concrete from the bottom up.\" Cement and Concrete Research 41 (2011) 727â€“735]_, cellular automota are used in microstructural modeling of the nucleation and growth of hydration products (brown) on cement particles (purple):\n",

    "## Step 2. Setting up Python\n",
    "You are using an iPython Notebook, also known as a Jupyter Notebook. By using this software you can write Python code and run it in your web browser, which can be very _convenient_!<br><br>\n",
    "Before we start writing code, you will need to _import_ two libraries called \"numpy\" and \"matplotlib.pyplot\". For convenience, we will also import numpy _as_ \"np\" and matplotlib.pyplot _as_ plt, so that we can type a shorter name when we use them. The third line of code makes matplotlib.pyplot produce output inline so we can easily see it in the Notebook.<br><br>\n",
    "Click on the cell below and press _Ctl-Enter_ on the keyboard to run the cell. This will import the libraries. Once complete you will see a number between the brackets \"In [ ]:\" displayed to the left of the cell."
