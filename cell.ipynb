    "## Background\n",
    "Cellular automata are discrete dynamical systems evolving on a grid of cells. These cells can be in a finite number of states (for example, on/off). The evolution of a cellular automaton is governed by a set of rules, describing how the state of a cell changes according to the state of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although extremely simple, these models can initiate highly complex and chaotic behaviors. Cellular automata can model real-world phenomena such as car traffic, chemical reactions, propagation of fire in a forest, epidemic propagations, and much more. Cellular automata are also found in nature. For example, the patterns of some seashells are generated by natural cellular automata.\n",

Bullard \"From electrons to infrastructure: Engineering concrete from the bottom up.\" Cement and Concrete Research 41 (2011) 727â€“735]_, cellular automota are used in microstructural modeling of the nucleation and growth of hydration products (brown) on cement particles (purple):\n",

    "Let's consider an elementary cellular automaton in one dimension. Every cell C has two neighbors (L and R), and it can be either off (0) or on (1). Therefore, the future state of a cell depends on the current state of L, C, and R. This triplet can be encoded as a number between 0 and 7 (three digits in binary representation).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular elementary cellular automaton is entirely determined by the outcome of each of these eight configurations. Therefore, there are 256 different elementary cellular automata (2^8). Each of these automata is identified by a number between 0 and 255.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider all eight LCR states in order: 111, 110, 101, ..., 001, 000. Each of the eight digits in the binary representation of the automaton's number corresponds to a LCR state (using the same order). For example, in the Rule 110 automaton (01101110 in binary representation), the state 111 yields a new state of 0 for the center cell, 110 yields 1, 101 yields 1, and so on. It has been shown that this particular automaton is Turing complete (or universal); it can theoretically simulate any computer program.\n",
